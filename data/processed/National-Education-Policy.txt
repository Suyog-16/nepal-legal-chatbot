Abstract 
Nepal's National Education Policy (NEP) serves as a transformative framework for achieving 
inclusive, equitable, and quality education while aligning with global standards such as Sustainable 
Development Goal 4 (SDG4). Recognizing education as a catalyst for socio-economic progress, 
the NEP emphasizes universal access, lifelong learning, and the integration of vocational and 
technical education. This study aims to critically examine the NEP’s historical evolution, its 
alignment with global goals, implementation challenges, and its contributions to addressing 
educational disparities and enhancing quality. The study adopts a qualitative methodology, relying 
on an extensive review of government documents, academic literature, and international reports. 
Thematic analysis was employed to evaluate the NEP's effectiveness in improving access, equity, 
and quality, alongside its potential to address youth unemployment through vocational education. 
The study shows notable progress in increasing literacy rates, school enrolment, and vocational 
training opportunities. However, challenges persist, including regional disparities, gender 
inequalities, inadequate teacher training, and insufficient coordination in decentralized 
governance. The results highlight the need for targeted interventions to bridge gaps in educational 
quality and equity. Achieving the NEP's objectives requires sustained investments, improved 
teacher training, strengthened public-private partnerships, and expanded digital infrastructure. 
Addressing these challenges will enable the NEP to foster a resilient, equitable, and inclusive 
education system that supports Nepal’s sustainable development goals. 
Keywords: National Education Policy, educational reform, equity, vocational education. 
Introduction 
The National Educational Policy (NEP) 2076 is a holistic approach to reshaping the country's 
education system. It corresponds with global agendas, notably the United Nations Sustainable 
Development Goal 4 (SDG4), which highlights quality and inclusive education for all and lifelong 
learning opportunities. The NEP notes the importance of education being a key driver of economic 
and social transformation, aiming for an educational system for all segments of the Nepalese 
population, including its rural, disadvantaged, and marginalized groups. These targets set by the 
policy aspire to universal access to education, enhancement of quality standards, and fusion of 
vocational and technical skills to match labor market needs at national and international levels 
(MoEST, 2019). 
The outlook of the NEP is inclusiveness, equity, and excellence. It stresses free and compulsory 
basic and secondary levels of education, mandated by Nepal's Constitution of 2015, which 
guarantees education as a fundamental right for every citizen. It aims not only to address
96

differences caused by socio-economic, gender, and regional inequities but also to create a culture 
of lifelong learning that will help students and workers prepare for the changing demands of a 
knowledge-intensive economy (Shields & Rappleye,2008). In addition, the recommendations 
cover the significance of TVET as a means of handling the urgent issue of youth unemployment 
and developing a skilled workforce that can drive the nation towards development. 
Decentralization is a guiding principle of the NEP. The framework allows provincial and local 
governments to empower regional education policies designed according to provincial needs. The 
reason was that this structure could provide more equitable resource allocation, responsible 
governance, and local community involvement in the process. This decentralized approach needs 
strong coordination between federal, provincial, and local governments to guarantee the 
consistency and effectiveness of policy implementation (Hamal,2020). 
The NEP acknowledges that technology-driven education systems and networks can eliminate 
regional disparities by providing equal access to global information and improving learning 
outcomes. In a country with such varying geography, [that] includes mountain terrain and remote 
villages, digital education offers a great solution to accessibility challenges. It encourages the 
development of digital infrastructure, e-learning platforms, and information and communication 
technology (ICT) in teaching and learning approaches (Rana et al., 2020). This transition is 
intended to, among other things, build a modern, technology-enabled education system, preparing 
students for 21st-century needs. 
In addition, the NEP reflects the educational needs of a country like Nepal, which has faced 
devastating earthquakes and floods, including education for disaster risk reduction and 
environmental education. In this context, the schools are envisioned as safe, revolving green living 
spaces, focusing on sustainability, disaster management, and resilience-building in students. 
Education system involving programs such as "One Student, One Plant" and community-based 
disaster preparedness training is rooted in the curriculum to create awareness and a sense of 
responsibility towards conserving the environment and safety. 
NEP is a paradigm shift to mitigate historical and systematic inadequacies in the education system 
of Nepal and bring it in consonance with global standards and aspirations. Focusing on inclusivity, 
quality, and innovation, the NEP envisions empowering Nepal's diverse population with the 
capabilities and opportunities needed to succeed within a rapidly changing global context. 
However, the policy's success hinges on surmounting significant implementation challenges, 
building strong coordination among stakeholders, and sustaining investments to realize its lofty 
objectives. This paper provides a critical perspective of the NEP's accomplishments, limitations, 
and pathways for the future, with recommendations for strengthening Nepal's education system 
and advancing its national development. 
Literature Review 
Education, as an important catalyst for the socio-economic transformation of any country, is 
essential for Nepal, significantly transcending its historical path of poverty, inequality, and 
underdevelopment. Education is a significant prerequisite for human capital development, which 
provides domestic capacity for people to acquire the skills, knowledge, and competencies required
97 
Political Science Journal, Volume 3, Issue 1, April, 2025 ISSN 2382-5189 
 
for economic productivity, social mobility, and civic participation (Caddell, 2007). Learning is a 
catalyst for innovation, a mechanism for poverty alleviation, and a means of enhancing the broad 
quality of life, and there will always be demand for it as a key driver of sustainable national 
advancement. Nepal's transition from a primarily agrarian economy to a more diversified economic 
structure depends on human capital and a skilled, educated, and adaptable workforce. A firm and 
well-implemented education policy like the NEP will undoubtedly be the backbone of the country's 
economic growth in the coming years by linking human resource development to national priorities 
like industrialization, digitalization, and infrastructure development. The long-term benefits of 
education investments include a competent workforce that is adaptable to global trends, providing 
a boost to national productivity (Dahal, 2024). 
In diverse nations like Nepal, education helps bridge socio-economic gaps and enhances social 
cohesion. The NEP seeks to transform educational opportunities for marginalized groups such as 
women, Dalits, and indigenous communities who have historically faced institutionalized 
obstacles to education by creating means of equitable access to quality education (Parasd, 2025). 
Educational programs for underprivileged communities help free them from the shackles of 
poverty and provide targeted scholarships and incentives to take responsibility for their 
communities.  
Further, education enriches civic engagement, expands political stability, promotes critical 
thinking, and nurtures informed citizenry (Thelma, 2024). In a country plagued by decades of 
political conflicts, education can be a source of stability, nurturing tolerance, democratic values, 
and social cohesion. It trains citizens to engage constructively in governance and decision-
making, further reinforcing Nepal's democratic institutions. Another important aspect is that it 
seems to conform to the UN Sustainability Goals' natural progressions. It recognizes that education 
is the key to equipping future generations with the knowledge and skills to combat climate change 
and ecological challenges. The policy emphasizes the importance of sustainability as a pillar of 
national development by incorporating environmental education into the curriculum. 
Education Policies in Nepal: An Evolution 
The history of formal education in Nepal started with the establishment of Durbar High School in 
1854 during the Rana regime. It was the first of its kind in the country. It was modelled after British 
educational practices and opened exclusively to children from elite families, especially those from 
the ruling class. There was no notable attempt to widen access for the general population, and 
education remained an elitist privilege of the top layers of society during this period 
(Niraula,2007). This was the case until 1951, when democracy came to Nepal, and the country's 
approach to education began to change. The democratic movement in 1951 led to the introduction 
of socio-political and economic changes, including the acknowledgment of education as a way to 
empower citizens and stimulate national growth (Bhandari, 2014). The thought process in the 
national project was reflected in the Constitution of the National Education Planning Commission 
(NEPC) in 1954, which paved the way for modern education policy in Nepal. NEPC recognized 
education as a key instrument of national development and poverty alleviation and stressed the 
need for universal primary education and technical training. It was the first official effort to 
address the systematic inequities in education accessibility that had historically defined Nepal's 
education system (Gurung, 2012).

The following years were marked by a series of incremental reforms directed toward expanding 
access to education and quality of education. The Education Act of 1971 introduced some 
significant structural changes, namely the creation of more public schools and community schools 
and the introduction of decentralization in education administration. These reforms were designed 
to improve enrollment rates and offer education to populations not previously served, like those in 
rural and remote areas. The Constitution of Nepal (2015) built upon these objectives by 
recognizing education as a fundamental right and making free and compulsory basic education the 
state's responsibility. This commitment to the Constitution demonstrates Nepal's alignment with 
international education goals, notably the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 4 
(SDG4), which stresses inclusive and equitable quality education for all people (Poudel & 
Costley,2023). 
Key Milestones in Educational Reform 
Nepal’s journey in education has been marked by several significant milestones that have shaped 
its current system: 
1. National Literacy Campaign (1990s): The 1990s witnessed a concerted effort to address 
illiteracy through nationwide literacy campaigns. These initiatives targeted adults and out-
of-school children, particularly in rural areas, and helped improve the overall literacy rate. 
However, disparities between urban and rural regions persisted, highlighting the need for 
sustained efforts. 
2. Education for All (EFA) Initiative (2000-2015): Aligned with global commitments under 
UNESCO, the EFA initiative aimed to ensure universal primary education, gender parity, 
and improved literacy rates. The program resulted in significant gains in school enrollment, 
particularly for girls and marginalized communities. However, challenges related to 
retention rates, quality of education, and teacher availability remained. 
3. School Sector Development Plan (SSDP, 2016-2023): The SSDP represents Nepal’s 
most comprehensive education reform plan to date, focusing on enhancing the quality, 
equity, and efficiency of the education system. Key priorities include teacher training, 
curriculum modernization, technical and vocational education, and the integration of 
technology in schools. Despite its ambitious goals, implementation has faced hurdles such 
as insufficient funding, regional disparities, and political instability. 
Governmental Role in Fiscal Decentralization in Schools 
The government of Nepal is a decision-maker in the education sector and is responsible for policy 
formulation, implementation, monitoring, etc. The Ministry of Education, Science and Technology 
is the leading authority that guides national educational priorities. Based on the constitutional 
mandates, especially stated by the Constitution of Nepal (2015), the government aims to provide 
access to education of good quality in a manner where no segment of the society experiences 
disparity. According to constitution recognition, education is a fundamental right, and free and 
compulsory education has to be provided up to the secondary level (Acharya & Sigdel,2024). The 
government's commitment towards these principles can be seen in alignment with the international 
frameworks that specifically provide for this, such as the United Nations Sustainable Development 
Goal 4 (SDG4), which states that we must ensure inclusive and equitable education for all.

Decentralization of responsibilities across the federal, provincial, and local levels is one of the 
defining features of Nepal's educational governance. For example, by a federal structure, local 
governments shape educational programs and interventions to suit local needs (Hamal, 2020). 
Decentralization allowed local communities to address their needs based on ground-level realities, 
prioritizing infrastructure, for instance, in rural schools, access to mother-tongue education for 
linguistic minorities, and gender-sensitive policies. Much larger authority was accorded to local-
level education committees to manage schools, hire teachers, oversee school performance, and 
disseminate resources as needed.  
Governments are responsible for secondary education, technical and vocational training programs 
at the provincial level, and basic education and early childhood development at the local 
government level. At all levels, the federal government maintains oversight of policy formulation, 
standard-setting, and quality assurance (Bhul,2024). This hierarchical governance structure 
indicates Nepal's attempt to cater to various educational needs across the country, from urban 
centres to remote mountainous regions. 
Political Parties and Their Educational Agenda 
Nepalese politics is dominated by political parties, which have a long history of being involved in 
formulating education policies. Political parties' manifestos, ideologies, and governance priorities 
shape the education reforms implemented. Education as an instrument of social justice and equity 
emerged as a dominant theme in the Maoist-led People's War (1996-2006) (Robins,2012). 
Maoists also stressed that it was through education that the marginalized and deprived sections of 
society would gain social, economic, and political power. School and community learning centers 
were perhaps the most prominent sites of political mobilization and advocacy for equitable access 
to education. 
Post-conflict, successive democratic governments have used education as a lever to tackle 
national issues such as youth unemployment and regional inequalities. Recent governments have 
emphasized technical and vocational training (TVET) programs to train the booming youth 
population with skills aligned with labor market demands (Ronald et al.,2024). This is part of an 
effort to build a bridge between education and employment—especially as Nepal further removes 
itself from an agrarian economy and becomes more dependent on industry and services. 
However, political instability and frequent changes in government have led to the disruption of 
the continuity of education policies in the country. In this system, short-term planning and 
implementation often lead to inefficiency as consistent long-term strategies are lacking. In 
addition, political interference in the management of schools, including the appointment of school 
officials based on party caps rather than merit, has weakened the integrity of governance in the 
education sector (Adhikari et al.,2023). It has signaled the need to ensure the stability of policy 
implementation and depoliticize education governance. 
Methodology 
This study adopts a qualitative approach, focusing on an intensive review of Nepal's National 
Education Policy (NEP) 2076, supported by analysis of academic literature, government

documents, and international reports. Key sources include the Constitution of Nepal (2015), the 
School Sector Development Plan (SSDP 2016–2023), and reports from UNESCO, UNICEF, and 
the World Bank. Thematic analysis was used to identify patterns and evaluate the NEP’s alignment 
with global standards and its effectiveness in addressing access, equity, quality, and vocational 
education. While the study primarily relies on secondary data, it offers a comprehensive overview 
of the NEP's scope and challenges, with a focus on policy improvements and implementation gaps. 
Findings and Discussion 
Nepal's National Education Policy (NEP) represents a comprehensive framework for transforming 
the nation's education system. Its core priorities are access, equity, quality, and the integration of 
technical and vocational education to prepare the workforce for national and global demands. 
However, while progress has been achieved in some areas, significant challenges persist across 
multiple dimensions. 
Access and Equity in Education: 
Nepal has made considerable headway in primary and essential school enrollment more recently. 
Data from the Ministry of Education, Science, and Technology (MoEST) shows that over 96% of 
net enrolment levels are at the primary level, which shows that we are close to universal education. 
However, these accomplishments were not without their attendant gaps in access that undermine 
equitable education provided to all citizens. Access and equity challenges are especially apparent 
along gender, socio-economic, and regional lines. Most rural and remote areas, especially in the 
hill and mountainous regions, have insufficient, less equipped schools and qualified teachers; 
hence, more prospects are in the primary phase. This geographic separation compounds inequities 
as students in these regions have significantly more trouble than those in urban areas accessing 
quality education. Systemic barriers to education exist for marginalized communities such as 
Dalits, indigenous groups, and economically disadvantaged families. For these groups, the 
challenges include opportunity costs associated with poverty, discriminatory practices, and more 
under-resourced schools. 
While gender gaps have been closing in recent years, they accrued over decades and persist as 
significant issues. Socio-culture set early marriage, child labor, and gender notions (for example, 
household responsibility) as hindrances to education, especially for girls, especially in rural areas, 
leading to high dropout rates. Although programs like scholarships for girls and awareness-raising 
initiatives have increased gender parity in enrolment, it will take continued investment to ensure 
that girls not only enter but also stay in school. Recognizing these issues, the NEP has also laid 
out some countermeasures. Mid-day meals, scholarships for disadvantaged groups, and gender-
sensitive infrastructure are some programs offered to eliminate barriers to education. The practical 
realization of these plans needs better coordination and allocation of resources, especially on the 
sub-national level. 
Developing Education and CurriculumQuality: 
Though education access has improved, education quality is still an ongoing problem. Quality 
metrics, such as student learning outcomes and teacher competency, show considerable voids that
101 
Political Science Journal, Volume 3, Issue 1, April, 2025 ISSN 2382-5189 
 
continue to undermine the efficacy of Nepal's education system. One of the major problems is the 
outdated curriculum, which often does not focus on current labor market requirements and does 
not encourage critical thinking and problem-solving skills. In response to these issues, the 
Curriculum Development Center (CDC) implemented curriculum development focusing on 
competency-based curricula, emphasizing skills like creativity, collaboration, and digital literacy. 
However, these reforms have faced hurdles in implementation, mainly due to the absence of 
teaching materials, insufficient training for teachers, and lack of monitoring systems. 
Another major challenge is the lack of qualified teachers, especially in rural and remote regions. 
A complete lack of continuing professional development for many teachers and demoralization 
due to low salaries, unfavorable conditions, and limited advancement opportunities in many under-
resourced schools, coupled with a lack of long-term knowledge-building opportunities. The need 
for better teacher training and professional development programs is well articulated in the NEP, 
but these efforts need financial and institutional wherewithal. 
The NEP prioritizes inclusive education and strives to create multilingual and culturally sensitive 
curricula for Nepal's diverse populace. While this is a step forward for equity, implementation is 
inconsistent, and many schools continue to have difficulty delivering teaching and learning in 
students' mother tongues or culturally relevant content. 
Technical and Vocational Education and Training: 
Vocational and technical education is a key pillar of Nepal's initiatives to combat youth 
unemployment and equip the workforce with the necessary skills to work in national and 
international labor markets. The government has launched programs to provide students with 
market-relevant skills through the Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET) 
framework in agriculture, engineering, and health sciences. These initiatives bridge the divide 
between education and employment, facilitating a workforce that can drive Nepal's economic 
growth. 
Although the increased availability of TVET programs has opened up opportunities for skill 
development, multiple challenges hinder their effectiveness. One major issue is a mismatch 
between vocational training programs and the market's needs. This detrimental disconnect between 
skills acquired and the need for skill sets as required by employers leads many TVET graduates 
to search for jobs, returning empty-handed. We need to be more cognizant of this disconnect and 
focus on developing stronger partnerships between academia and industry to ensure that the 
curricula align with labor market trends. 
Vocational education is also affected by regional disparities in access. Many TVET programs are 
located in major cities, creating an accessibility gap for students who reside in rural areas. For this 
reason, NEP recommends the decentralization of vocational education and promotes provincial 
and local administrations initiating training centers serving the interests of regional areas. 
A major barrier is the perception that vocational education is a second-class alternative to 
academic education. "For many students and parents, TVET programs are seen as a backup option 
instead of an alternate pathway to socio-economic mobility." The stigma attached to TVET cannot
102 
Political Science Journal, Volume 3, Issue 1, April, 2025 ISSN 2382-5189 
 
be overcome until the government actively promotes TVET alongside the appreciation of 
vocational training through awareness raising and pathways for TVET graduates towards higher 
education or entrepreneurship.Challenges and Barriers 
Nepal's National Education Policy (NEP) has ambitious goals for transforming the country's 
education system, but its implementation is hindered by a range of challenges and barriers. These 
challenges span political, socio-economic, and geographic dimensions, complicating efforts to 
provide equitable and quality education for all. 
Political Instability and Its Impact on Education: 
Nepal's political landscape has seen frequent government flips, long interims, and instability that 
have profoundly affected the education sector. Education policies take time to implement and 
require long-term strategies, but national and local leadership turnover has created inconsistencies 
in policy enforcement. The absence of continuity in leadership prevents vital reforms from being 
expedited, plans for funding allocation being maintained, and active educational programs being 
pushed forward. For example, initiatives related to education introduced during one administration 
often encounter neglect or revision under successive governments, with lingering effects on 
programs and consequences for students and educators alike. 
This political meddling in local school governance only adds to inefficiency. Loyalty superseding 
merit and capacity in appointing school officials and administrators leads to incompetence, 
diminished accountability, and governance." Such political upheaval leads to resource waste, poor 
policy implementation, and deterioration in the quality of education. 
Implementation of Socio-Economic Factors: 
Deep poverty and income inequality across Nepal provide significant barriers to education. 
Education takes a back seat to economic and social necessity, and this, in patriarchal societies, 
means that the long-term liberation of an educated woman is the least on a male child's list. Such 
economic strain leads many children to leave school to support their families through agricultural 
work or other labor. Such dropout rates are exceptionally high in remote regions where poverty is 
more severe, perpetuating the cycle of poverty and illiteracy. 
Language diversity and cultural norms also challenge making curricula standardized and 
inclusive. There are 120 languages spoken in Nepal, making it challenging to formulate and 
implement educational material addressing all languages. The NEP encourages education in 
multiple languages, but few schools have the means — or the trained staff — to teach in local 
languages. The roles of culture and gender-based discrimination also explain the differences in 
access to education experienced by girls in less developed, rural spaces. Early marriage, as well as 
the preference for educating boys over girls, are standard practices that continue to increase the 
gender gap. 
Regional Discrepancies in Access to Education:
103 
Political Science Journal, Volume 3, Issue 1, April, 2025 ISSN 2382-5189 
 
Nepal's geographical diversity, with its vast maritime, hilly, and plains regions, has resulted in 
significant regional differences in educational access. Education in the rural area also has the 
problem of infrastructure. Deficiencies in infrastructure discourage attendance and create adverse 
learning conditions for students. 
Logistical hurdles like lack of transportation underscore these inequities. Children often have to 
walk far to school in remote areas, so enrollment and dropout rates are higher. Furthermore, the 
shortage of teachers in rural and soared mountains has remained a serious problem. As rural 
schools compete for licensed teachers, many qualified professionals gravitate toward urban 
settings with better living conditions, leaving understaffed schools to rely on half-prepared 
teachers. 
With an eye on national outcomes, separating education structures has not done enough to address 
these inequalities. Decentralization and localized planning initiatives have had some impact, but 
better coordination and resources are required. The NEP recognizes the need to strengthen local 
governments to formulate local solutions, but the disparity of resources and capacity hampers 
progress. 
Implementation Strategies 
Government initiatives and Programs: 
Nepal has initiated numerous programs by the government to improve the education sector's 
quality, equity, and success. Among them, the most prominent plan is the School Sector 
Development Plan (SSDP) (2016-2023), which upholds quality education with equitable access 
and systemic inefficiency. The SSDP focuses on teacher training, curriculum development, and 
the infrastructure for building child-friendly schools. It also seeks to bridge gaps in access to 
education for marginalized communities — Dalits, indigenous groups, and children with 
disabilities. 
Moreover, local governments have been authorized under Nepal's federal structure to address 
region-specific educational needs. Decentralization facilitates increased community involvement 
in school governance, allowing local actors to take responsibility for educational development. At 
the local level, education committees are also heavily involved in resource distribution, overseeing 
the functioning of schools, and adapting the curriculum — making education policies relevant to 
the region. Other initiatives in this regard include government-run school enrollment drives and 
scholarships aimed at economically challenged students. 
Funding and Allocation of Resources: 
Though an increase in the educational budget has been announced in recent years, this is 
inadequate to fulfill Nepal's education needs in the long run. Issues such as a lack of infrastructure, 
a shortage of teachers, and new learning materials require substantial financial resources. As a 
result of this shortfall, Nepal has depended mainly upon international organizations such as 
UNICEF, the World Bank, and UNESCO for financial and technical support. Partnerships market
104 
Political Science Journal, Volume 3, Issue 1, April, 2025 ISSN 2382-5189 
 
access can result in infrastructure finance, capacity development (teacher education), and access 
expansion (to remote regions). 
However, the reliance on outside funding creates fears about sustainability. Nepal's education 
policy has stressed the need to develop public-private partnerships and promote local investment 
through school development grants. Separating education institutions from direct dependence on 
specific ministries will not only broaden the range of available funding options but also foster 
greater efficiency in allocating and utilizing resources. 
Evaluation of Policy Outcomes: 
The National Education Policy (NEP) is one of Nepal's monumental, directional policy 
frameworks with traces of some measurable reforms in the education system. Some notable results 
have been improved literacy rates and increased primary-level enrolment. These results reflect the 
success of programs such as the School Sector Development Plan (SSDP) and Education for All 
(EFA) initiated by the government, prioritizing the minimum access to education for all. These 
advances have also been greatly aided through enrolment drives, scholarships for 
underrepresented communities, and gender-focused initiatives. 
However, despite those gains, quality and equity gaps in education remain. Systemic barriers 
faced by marginalized communities such as Dalits, indigenous groups, and economically 
disadvantaged populations restrict access to quality education. There are also challenges with 
insufficient school infrastructure, lack of well-trained teachers, and restricted access to learning 
resources in rural and remote areas. Many policy evaluations have consistently emphasized the 
importance of targeted interventions to address these disparities. This encompasses equitable 
distribution of resources, quality teacher training, and mitigating socio-cultural barriers that 
marginalize specific communities. 
Future Directions: 
There is a compelling need for specific advances and strategic reforms to realize the vision of 
Nepal’s National Education Policy (NEP). A holistic and layered approach, including 
decentralization, teacher training, public-private partnerships, equity, and digital learning, is 
crucial for addressing the chronic problem of the education sector. A crucial measure in mitigating 
regional disparities is strengthening decentralization, which allows local governments to design 
appropriate solutions to problems, such as low-cost infrastructure and a shortage of teachers, 
tailored to local needs. A companion to this idea is the work that should be done to improve teacher 
training, perhaps by introducing extensive, continuous professional development programs to 
strengthen pedagogical skills, sustain innovative teaching and learning methods, and ensure that 
all educators can cater to diverse student needs. Such measures address the need to raise the 
quality of education overall while closing gaps between regions and demographics. 
Moreover, sync public-private partnerships can greatly complement government initiatives, 
especially in infrastructure building, vocational training, and digital learning. Innovative solutions 
and funding shortfalls can be addressed through the collaboration of the public and private sectors. 
Initiatives with an equity focus are also critically important; they are aimed at supporting those 
groups who are in marginalized positions: girls, ethnic minorities, and children with disabilities.
105 
Political Science Journal, Volume 3, Issue 1, April, 2025 ISSN 2382-5189 
 
Scholarships, mid-day meals, and inclusive curricula that reflect Nepal’s cultural and linguistic 
diversity are some tools that can help ensure that no group is left behind. The COVID-19 pandemic 
has shown it clearly: we must also shift our focus to expanding digital learning infrastructure and 
e-learning platforms. It will also minimize geographical imbalance and create new opportunities 
for distance education by assuring uniform access to technology and ICT tools, particularly in 
rural areas. 
Emerging Trends in Education: 
However, one of the most prominent trends influencing the future of learning in Nepal is the 
integration of technology in education. The use of e-learning platforms and digital tools during 
the COVID-19 pandemic created new opportunities for distance education, helping students in 
remote areas. The human touch remains essential, but when these can be deployed, they enhance 
access and realization of learning further. 
Moreover, the global focus on science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) 
education resonates with Nepal, and it aims to equip its workforce with tools for the challenges 
ahead. Widespread implementation of STEM education at all levels promotes innovation, critical 
thinking, and workforce readiness, allowing students to become equipped to respond to the labor 
market needs of our nation and the world. 
Conclusion 
The NEP has played a crucial role in increasing access to education and raising literacy rates in 
Nepal. However, a persistent set of challenges around quality, equity, and political stability 
hampers its potential. To solve the problems, continuous infusions of resources, targeted 
interventions, and improved local governance will be needed. While education acts both as an 
engine and a buffer of political and socio-economic development, education can mitigate political 
instability and fulfil Nepal’s aspirations for sustainable development by nurturing critical 
thinkers, building social cohesion, and developing a workforce for the economy. A strong and 
progressive education policy is essential for creating a resilient, just, and prosperous Nepal. NEP 
should be reformed and approached innovatively to become a great framework of transformation 
for long-term results based on national development.
