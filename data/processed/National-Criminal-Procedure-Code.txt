If the law in force does not give any name to the offence pursuant to sub-section (3), name shall be so given to the offence, also having regard to the elements of the offence according to the nature of the offence, that the accused can clearly understand the charge made against him or her. If information is received that the accused has already been sentenced for any offence or the accused should be liable to enhanced punishment by the reason that the accused has also been previously convicted of any offence, the charge sheet filed pursuant to sub-section (1) shall also mention the date of previous conviction of the accused, the name of the court awarding the punishment and the case or if such matter is discovered later, it shall be mentioned as and when so discovered. If the government attorney makes decision not to institute a case against any person in connection with any offence pursuant to sub-section (3) of Section 31 owing to the fact that the evidence and proof collected for the time being in connection with that offence are not sufficient enough to institute the case against that person, and if such offence also involves a matter of civil liability related to the loss of and damage to the personal property or amount of any person, the government attorney shall give information thereof to the informant or the victim of such offence, through the concerned investigating authority.

(13) Except as otherwise provided in this Chapter, where a bail/bond or guarantee has been taken from any person in the course of investigation and, upon investigation, decision is made not to institute the case against him or her, the bail/bond or guarantee so furnished shall be returned to such person. Filing of charge sheet claiming for lesser punishment: (1) Notwithstanding anything contained elsewhere in this Chapter, if the accused of any offence assists the investigating authority in the course of conducting investigation into such offence, the investigating authority may, in consideration for such assistance, recommend to the government attorney for a reduction in the sentence than can be imposed on such accused under the law. If a recommendation is received pursuant to sub-section (2), the government attorney may, also having regard to such recommendation, file a charge sheet with conditional claims, with a proposal for a reduction in the sentence that can be imposed on the accused. In filing a charge sheet pursuant to sub-section (2), the government attorney may file the charge sheet proposing for a reduction in the sentence as follows: If the accused pleaded guilty of the offence in whole, before the investigating authority or prosecuting authority, a reduction of a maximum of twenty-five percent of the sentence that can be imposed on the accused, If the accused pleaded guilty of the offence in which he or she was also involved and assisted in revealing detailed facts as to the offence and the other offenders or gang involved in the offence or the principal giving direction to commit the offence or in arresting the persons involved in the offence or, in the case of any organized offence or offence committed in a group, in locating the other persons involved in that offence or the place where criminal conspiracy of such offence was made, in seizing or forfeiting any motor vehicle, machine, equipment or other object or arms used for the commission of such offence, a reduction of a maximum of fifty percent of the sentence that can be imposed on the accused. In order to make a pray for the reduction in the sentence under sub-section (2), the documents contained in the case-file of the concerned case shall clearly demonstrate that such accused has rendered such assistance.

If, after the filing of a charge sheet praying for a reduction in the sentence pursuant to sub-section (2), the accused makes before the court a deposition that is different from the deposition which he or she has made before the investigating authority or the government attorney or furnishes hostile evidence or denies committing the offence or does not assist in judicial proceedings, such accused shall not be entitled to get the facility referred to in this Section. In the case referred to in sub-section (6), the government attorney shall revoke the reduction of sentence proposed pursuant to sub-section (1) or (2) and make a petition to the court praying for additional sentence, and such petition shall be an integral part of the same charge sheet. Cases on minor offences of specific type may not be filed: (1) If it appears that it is not practicable to file a case on any minor offence of any specific type or it does not substantially affect public interests, the government attorney may, with the approval of the Attorney General, decide not to file a case against such person. Prior to making decision pursuant to sub-section (1), the government attorney shall cause a bond to be executed by such accused undertaking not to repeat such offence in the future.

If a case is not filed pursuant to sub-section (1) and such person commits any offence under this Act within three years from such date, such person shall be liable to the sentence to which the sentence that can be imposed on him or her for the previous offence shall also be added. Notwithstanding anything contained elsewhere in this Section, if the government attorney makes decision not to institute a case, the victim party who is not satisfied with such decision may file a case on his or her own behalf. If decision is made not to institute a case pursuant to sub-section (7), a notice thereof shall be given to the victim immediately; and, for that purpose, the statute of limitation under law shall be deemed to commence from the date of receipt of the notice of such decision. The concerned government attorney shall provide copies of the documents related to the investigation conducted pursuant to this Chapter to the person who files a case pursuant to sub-section (7).

If a request is made pursuant to sub-section (5) and such reason is reasonable, the court may, assigning the reasons for the same, take deposition of such witness immediately.

Notwithstanding anything contained in sub-section (3), if any party, due to a force majeure event, remains absent on the date appointed for appearance for confirming whether a document is genuine or forged, and if the party or his or her representative appears within fifteen days of the appointment of such date and wishes to express any matter about that document, such party or representative shall be given an opportunity to make expression accordingly. 105.
