# About The Project

NyaySathi is a legal chatbot for Nepal that helps users understand and explore the Constitution, Acts, Policies, and Regulations of the country in simple English.  
It uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to fetch accurate and up-to-date legal information from trusted government sources and responds with clear explanations along with citations from official legal documents.

The project aims to make Nepalese law accessible, understandable, and searchable for:  
- Citizens seeking legal awareness  
- Law students exploring legal frameworks  
- Professionals looking for quick legal references  

NyaySathi bridges the gap between citizens and complex legal texts — one query at a time.

- Constitution of Nepal
